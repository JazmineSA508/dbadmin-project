      <strong>IS 117:</strong> Taught me about web development. I already had experience with web design from high school when I took a web design class in junior year. It was my first elective course that I ever took in college, mainly because I knew that I'd do well since I already had knowledge of it. I learned so much in this class and made a really great looking project that I actually used as a <a href="https://web.njit.edu/~jsa48/FinalProjectSite/finalProjectIndex.html">direct template for this current project</a>. Talk about utilizing your resources!<br><br>
	  <strong>IT 202:</strong> Taught me about the backend aspects of web development. I learned about PHP (even though I'm still not very good at it) IT 340, IT 610, IT 640 and IT 635. This is a tricky thing to explain. The textbook definition of music is: &quot;1. vocal or instrumental sounds (or both) combined in such a way as to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion&quot; or &quot;2. The written or printed signs representing vocal or instrumental sound.&quot;It's not to say that these textbook definitions are wrong per se, but it is hard to grasp the definition of something that has been around since the dawn of time and that everyone perceives differently.</p>
    <p>Music is, in layman's terms, a form of expression. You can write a song about absolutely nothing, or you can pour your heart and soul into a song. You can make a song full of hidden meanings, like PSY's &quot;Gangnam Style&quot;, or it can be very straightforward, like every song off of Beyonce's album <em>Lemonade</em>.<br />
