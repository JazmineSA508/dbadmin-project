			<h1>What are Musical Keys?</h1>
            <p><img src="./images/music_keys.jpg" alt="The 12 Keys of Music" width="424" height="252"></p>
			<p>A music key is the most important part of music besides the time signature (explained below) and the notes themselves. It tells the sharps and flats used in the song and the scale that the song is based on. Sharps are pitches that are in the middle of a note and the note after it; Flats are pitches that are in the middle of a note and the note before it; and playing a note the way it normally sounds is called a natural. As listed in the picture, there are 12 music keys that can be played.</p>

            	<h1>What are Time Signatures?</h1>
                <p><img src="./images/time_sig.jpg" alt="Simple Time Signatures"></p>
            	<p>Time signatures are very important in a song. It is comprised of 2 numbers, one on top of the other. The top number represents the number of beats per measure/bar. The bottom number represents what kind of note gets 1 beat. Common Time, which is usually indicated by a &quot;c&quot;, is 4/4; this means that there are 4 beats/bar and a quarter note gets 1 beat. Fun fact: A waltz is usually in 3/4 time.</p>
