    <h1>How do you write and compose music?</h1>
    <article>
    <img src="./images/what_is_it.jpg" alt="Music on the Mind Picture">
    <p>Writing music is, in a way, like writing in a journal. It can be about anything you want. From yourself, to world events, to other people, to the universe, etc., you can about anything and make it into a song. Like the definition of music, there is no clear cut way to write and compose music. An easy way is to start with the words, then move on to what you want the sound of the song to be.</p>
    <p>This is something that you have to look within yourself to really achieve. MILMIL, Inc. can give you the information you need to know what music is and how to understand and appreciate it. However we can't give you creativity; that is something that is impossible to teach.</p>
    <p>This is where you gain your independence from MILMIL, Inc. We've given you the tools. Now you can use your newly learned knowledge to help express yourself through the wonderfulness that is the art of music. But, if you still need our assistance, you can contact us <a href="./contactUs.php">here</a></p>
    <p>Get out there and start writing. And always remember: <em><strong>Music will live on FOREVER!</strong></em><br />
